In this workshop you will learn the latest and greatest tools and techniques to improve your ability to test modern web applications.

You will focus on a holistic approach of testing front-end, APIs, and back-end.

You will analyze risks and prevent those risks with functional testing, api testing, visual testing and a lot more üí™

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

The best and safest way to ensure that we all have the same environment is for us to use Gitpod for our workshop. However, if you understand
how to configure node and nvm, you are free to setup the environment on your machine as well.

---

## Gitpod setup

‚ÑπÔ∏è Gitpod lets you run an entire Dev environment from a browser! You can use this approach if you don't know how to setup a local Java environment.

### 1.Fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.
- Give the repo a ‚≠ê or you can't participate in the workshopüòù

3. In the browser address bar, prepend the GitHub url (`https://github.com/USERNAME/automation-best-practices-java`) with `https://gitpod.io/#`
    * The resulting url should look as follows:
   
      > https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/comprehensive-testing-js
   
4. Once the Gitpod.io URL is loaded, you will need to sign in with the GitHub account you created earlier 
5. Once the development environment is loaded, you should see 'Ready to test!' in the Terminal window in the lower portion of the window, run the following commands in that Terminal to set your `SAUCE_USERNAME`, `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY`, and `SCREENER_API_KEY`:

:information_source:&nbsp; You can get your Sauce Labs Username and Access Key by going to the [Sauce Labs user settings page](https://app.saucelabs.com/user-settings)

:information_source:&nbsp; You can get your Screener API Key by going to the [API key](https://screener.io/v2/account/api-key) page in your Screener settings

```bash
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_USERNAME=<sauce_username>)
eval $(gp env -e SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY=<sauce_access_key>)
eval $(gp env -e SCREENER_API_KEY=<screener_api_key>)
```

> Replace <sauce_username>, <sauce_access_key>, and <screener_api_key> with your credentials

Once you have run those 3 commands, you can run the following commands to test your environment variables:

```bash
echo $SAUCE_USERNAME
echo $SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY
echo $SCREENER_API_KEY
```

Run sanity tests

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=SanityTest -X
```

### 1. Install Node 14 LTS

1.  Use NVM for this installation by [following instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
    - It should be just a single command to run in our terminal
      - **!Don't forget to restart your terminal!**
    -  After installation, confirm install with `nvm --version`
3.  Intall Node 16 with `nvm install --lts`

  </details>
  <br/><br/>

- Confirm node installation with `node --version` and seeing `v14.16.1` or similar
- Confirm NVM is set to 14 for default by running the following commands:

```bash
nvm list #will show all versions
nvm use 14 #to use 14
nvm alias default 16.14.x #to set it to the default
```

### 2.Clone and fork the repo

1. Sign up for a free [Github account](https://github.com/)
2. Fork this respository

- Make sure you are logged into Github
- click the Fork in the upper right of the Github.

3. Clone your fork of the repository to your machine. Must have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

```bash
git clone URL_OF_YOUR_FORK
```

4. **Navigate to the directory of where you cloned your repo**

`cd YOUR_FORK_DIR/automation-best-practices/testing-for-charity`

### 3.Install the app

```bash
cd testing-for-charity/my-react-app
npm install && npm start
```

**Don't worry about fixing any warnings that may appear during `npm install`**

Once the app is running, kill the server by executing `Ctrl + C` in command line. We don't need the app running right now.

### 4.Have an IDE installed that can handle NodeJS/JS (We will use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download))

#### ‚úÖüëèCongratulations, your environment is ready!

### 5.Sign up for a free [Sauce account](https://saucelabs.com/sign-up)

Get your [Screener account](https://saucelabs.com/demo-request-vt)

### 6.Set Your Sauce Labs Credentials
